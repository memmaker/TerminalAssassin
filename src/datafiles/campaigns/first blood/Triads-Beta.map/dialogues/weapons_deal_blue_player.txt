$RD_LEADER: Let's get this over with. I have places to be.

$PLAYER: I'll make it quick then. What do you have for me?

$RD_LEADER: I can offer you a shipment of AK-47s for a fair price.

$PLAYER: Highly reliable, nice penetration, and easy to use.

$RD_LEADER: I'm glad you like them. I can give you 50 for the right price.

$PLAYER: I am looking for something a bit more accurate.

$RD_LEADER: How about some grenade launchers? They'll blow your mind.

$PLAYER: That sounds like a lot of fun, but I need something more subtle.

$RD_LEADER: Subtlety is my middle name. How about some Glocks then?

$PLAYER: Glocks will do. How many can you get me?

$RD_LEADER: How about 60? I can give you a discount for bulk orders.

$PLAYER: 60 sounds good. What's the price?

$RD_LEADER: Don't worry, you'll get your money's worth.
$RD_LEADER: These are top-of-the-line firearms.
$RD_LEADER: The total price will be $150,000.

$PLAYER: That's a steep price. Can you come down a bit?

$RD_LEADER: I could, but then I'd have to reduce the quality of the merchandise.
$RD_LEADER: You don't want that, do you?

$PLAYER: Of course not. Alright, $150,000 it is.
$PLAYER: I have your money right here.
