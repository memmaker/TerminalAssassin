# DX Stuff

How to use environmental hazards:

# SABOTAGE & TRAPS
 - Direct melee interaction (push button, change settings, place item, sabotage)
   - Opt: Guarded by specific item possession
 - Unique item interaction: Needs a specific item to interact with the environment
 - Can trigger and/or be triggered by NPC schedule
 - Also all triggers, distributions and effects can be used for traps
 - Remote triggers & phone calls

# DIRECT IMPACT
 - Ranged interaction: Shooting at explosive barrels, dropping big objects by shooting the wires, etc.
 - Triggered by projectile impact
 - Will directly apply effect: Drop (kill), release gas, explode

# PUSHING
 - Pushing a victim into it (chasms, fire, deadly pits, sharp objects, wood crushers, etc.)

# NPCs
 - Manipulation of NPC schedules
 - NPCs could also sabotage the environment, kill people, push them, etc.


# Smoking NPCs
NPCs have a "Smoker" flag.

Smokers will pick up cigarettes and smoke them.

Smoking Zones. Any NPC with cigarettes that has a task in a smoking
Zone will smoke. If an ashtray is in the same zone, it will be used.
Otherwise the cigarette will be dropped on the ground.

NPCs will pick up a pack of cigarettes that are right next to a task location.

If a smoking NPCs acquires cigarettes and has no task in a smoking zone, he will sooner or later go there.
If no smoking zone is available, he will smoke randomly on his schedule.

# Pathfinding
 - Make the pathfinding aware of NPCs that hold keys
 - NPCs with keys should unlock and lock doors behind them
 - NPCs should avoid hazards like fire, chasm, etc.

# Design
 - Cells
   - Tile
   - Object
   - Item
   - Actor

 - Tiles
   - no behaviour
   - no context actions
   - tile flags (bloody, wet, on fire, poisonous, etc)
 - Items
   - inventory items
   - mix and match: triggers & effects
   - pick up, drop, throw, use
 - Actors
   - player
   - ai (civilian, guard, enforcer, target)
 - Objects
   - environment objects (doors, cabinets, sinks, etc)
   - have context action depending on state and player inventory action
   - most will only be used by the player
   - although: ai must walk through doors and should open cabinets and chests

 - A map consists of cells
 - Each cell can hold a tile, an inventory item and an actor
 - The player is also an actor
 - Actors differ based on their base and behaviour
 - Inventory Items are built from pre-defined components that can be combined at will
 - Objects are specialized things that have individual behaviour (eg. doors, chests, etc)
   - Objects cannot be picked up
   - Objects cannot be moved
   - Objects provide context actions

# Approach to data files
 - Some things are hardcoded but parametrized:
   - Effects
   - Applications
   - Distributions
   - Triggers
 - Objects have pre-defined behaviour but can be defined to appear differently
 - Data Files are needed for:
   - Custom List of items
   - Custom List of objects
   - Custom List of tiles
   - The map, referencing and saving all of the above
   - A mission briefing file
   - Mission metadata (name, author, version, etc)
 - Keys & Clothing are just strings defined in the editor and saved to the map file

# REALLY NEEDED

 - Synchronize the actions/schedules of multiple actors for meetings, etc.
 - Bodyguards
 - Real movement mechanics (walking, sneaking, running)
 - Locked Doors, Keys & Lockpicking
 - Changing clothes & Enforcers seeing through them
 - Civilian panic behavior
 - AI remembering when the player's disguise is compromised
 - Zones with "no trespassing" behavior for different clothes
 - Guards cleaning up weapons & bodies

## Scenario 1 - Hitman Mission 1 - Triad Meeting

 - 2 Gang Leader + Bodyguards
 - Shoot with pistol
 - Shoot with sniper
 - Knock out with throw, break neck
 - Kill with lethal throw
 - Choke out from behind
 - Poison with lethal injection
 - Incite a gang war
 - Hide a bomb

## Scenario 2 - Hitman Mission 2 - House on the beach

 - Multiple Bodyguards

## Stage 3

 - Explosives & Fire propagation
 - Flooding & Water propagation
