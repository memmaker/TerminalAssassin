The two biggest triad gang leaders in the city are meeting
up for a negotiation at a local park. Intelligence suggests
that they'll be discussing a major arms deal.

Your target is the leader of the Dragons,
who has a reputation for being particularly ruthless.

We've set you up with a high-powered sniper rifle and a
vantage point in a warehouse opposite the park.

You'll find it here.

Take out your target with a single, clean shot.

But be careful - these gangsters are heavily guarded
and won't go down without a fight.

# Audio: "slide07", Image: "target"

Use your stealth and precision to eliminate your target
and extract safely.

Remember, your mission is to take out the Dragons leader only
- do not engage the second leader unless absolutely necessary.
