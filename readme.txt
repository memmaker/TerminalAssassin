# Directed interactions

You can interact with objects in five directions:
The four cardinal directions around you (N,E,S,W) and the objects on the tile you are standing on.

There is a dedicated button for triggering context actions in each of these directions.

The status line will show you which directional button will equate to which action at any time.

# Sneaking context actions

Some actions are performed implicitly through the act of sneaking.

Sneaking is achieved by just go very slow between tiles.

In addition to being more stealthy when moving, sneaking can also be used to perform the following actions:

## Wiping blood splatters from the ground using a cleaning rag

Equip a cleaning rag and sneak over a blood splatter to wipe it away.

## Dragging unconscious/dead bodies to a better place

Sneak over a body to drag it to a better place.

## Concepts
 - One screen per mission/map, no scrolling
 - One tile per thing, no multi-tile things
 - One thing per tile, no overlapping things of the same kind
 - One context action per tile, no multiple actions per tile
 - Names of items and clothes must be unique as they are used as identifiers
