# Setting the scene

We will be working on my game project.
It's a terminal based assassination stealth game for terminals and uses simple 2D graphics on a tile based grid.
The game is heavily inspired by the Hitman and the Thief series with some nods towards the general spy & crime genre.

# The characters

The player will be playing as a hitman who is hired by a freelance agency to assassinate targets.
The player always is allowed to choose his own name, so we can't ever refer to him directly.

Contractor 23 - The player character

Each hitman is assigned a handler, basically a fixer who will provide the assassin with new targets, relevant intel and general support.

Amy Sterling - The handler - Codename Nightingale

# Factions

The International Contract Agency (ICA) is a freelance agency that hires hitmen to assassinate targets.

The Triads are a criminal organization that is based in Hong Kong and is known for their ruthless and brutal methods.
Red Dragon is the Triads' most prominent and powerful faction.
Blue Lotus is one of the Triads' most feared factions.

# Actions

I need some in-universe flavour texts for this game now.

I need a conversation in a brief style. Suitable for displaying not more than one line per utterance.
Precede each line with the name of the character who is speaking.

I want you to write a conversation between two characters who are negotiating a major arms deal.

The character you are providing with text is the handler, Amy Sterling.

Provide me some short but quippy sentences that a british spy might utter to a hitman who failed his assignment.
